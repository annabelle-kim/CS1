The Dynamic maze is a maze that changes everytime it is played. The code helps the bot drive to the finish point no matter what the maze may look like.
The word scramble game is where a word is randomly chosen and the letters are all scrambled up. The user must unscramble the word the least amount of tries.
The Rock Paper Scissors code is a python version of Rock Paper Scissors. The user has the choice to play multiple different gamemodes. All they have to do is type in the option they want to chose.
